Tracking Algorithms for Phagocytes and other moving objects.

## Instalation
After cloning the repository, it is important to add it (with subfolders) to the
Matlab path. Full manual and instructions can be found
[here](http://www.phagosight.org/).

## Usage
[Phagosight](http://www.phagosight.org/) can be used with the help of a GUI that
allows the user to select manually the folder where the data is in. This is done
by the command
```Matlab
[handles] = neutrophilAnalysis();
```
